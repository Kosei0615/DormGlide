## ✉️ Supabase Purchase Emails

DormGlide can send purchase-request and purchase-confirmation emails using a Supabase Edge Function.

1. Create the function in your Supabase project:
   - File already included: supabase/functions/notify-purchase/index.ts

2. Log in and link your project:
   - supabase login
   - supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>

3. Set required secrets for the function:
   - supabase secrets set SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co
   - supabase secrets set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service-role-key>

4. Deploy the function:
   - supabase functions deploy notify-purchase

5. Verify invocation in app flow:
   - requestPurchase triggers notify-purchase with event purchase_requested
   - confirmPurchase triggers notify-purchase with event purchase_confirmed

6. Optional local test:
   - supabase functions serve notify-purchase --env-file ./supabase/.env

Note: this implementation calls a helper function named send-email from notify-purchase. Ensure send-email exists in your Supabase project and is configured to deliver outbound email.
